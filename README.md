# Flashcard-Generator

This is the backend for a basic flashcard application.
It includes basic flash cards, and cloze cards, where a piece of text is removed.

For example, you might have the partial text "... is the first president of the US."
And the piece of text removed, the 'cloze', is "George Washington".

You can add new cloze flashcards from the terminal.
The flashcards are saved in a Firebase database.
